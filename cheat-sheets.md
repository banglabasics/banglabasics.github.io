title: Cheat Sheets

The cheat sheets here are meant to be quick reference pages for different aspects of Bangla.
This isn't a comprehensive guide, so I highly recommend a book like Hanne-Ruth Thompson's
<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Bengali/C7vz0ABJnJsC?hl=en&gbpv=0" target="_blank">*Bengali*</a>.
I've included page numbers from Thompson's book throughout these pages for further reading.
