# Welcome! স্বাগতম!
This website is meant to be an introduction to Bengali grammar.
We'll cover both the standard written language
as well as the dialect of Bengali spoken in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
While Bengali can be intimidating for English speakers,
I've tried to make this guide approachable for learners of any level.

We'll cover the fundamentals of Bengali grammar in a few parts:
1. **Introduction**
2. **Writing**
3. **Nouns**
4. **Pronouns**
5. **Verbs**
6. **Word Order**
