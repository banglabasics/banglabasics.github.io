title: Nouns

Nouns in Bangla are quite regular. 
Bengali has no grammatical gender;
rather, we can classify nouns into two groups:
human and non-human.

A noun by itself (without any suffixes) can be singular or plural depending on context.

> আমি আম কাটছি। <br>
> *Ami am kaṭchi.* <br>
> 'I am cutting (a) mango.'

> গাছে আম আছে। <br>
> *Gache am ache.* <br>
> 'There are mangoes on the tree.'

## Definiteness and Number

The definite suffixes in Bangla are somewhat like the definite article 'the' in English.
The suffix we use depends on whether the word is singular or plural
and human or non-human.
These suffixes are as follows:

|     | non-human | human |
| :--------------- | :----- | :----- |
| **unmarked**          | (none) | (none) |
| **definite singular** | -টা *-ṭa* <br> -টি *-ṭi* | -টা *ṭa* <br> -টি *-ṭi* |
| **definite plural**   | -গুলা *-gula* (East), -গুলো *-gulo* (West) <br> -গুলি *-guli* | -(এ)রা *-(e)ra* |

Where there are multiple suffixes, the one at the top is the most common one.
The suffixes -টি *-ṭi* and -গুলি *-guli* are basically equivalent to their counterparts,
but they can also indicate sympathy or smallness.

The human plural suffix has three forms:
- -রা *-ra* after vowels 
  - মহিলা *mohila* 'woman' > মহিলারা *mohilara* '(the) women'
- -এরা *-era* after consonants 
  - বোন *bon* 'sister' > বোনেরা *bonera* '(the) sisters'
- -য়েরা *-yera* after one-syllable words that end in a vowel 
  - মা *ma* 'mother' > মায়েরা *mayera* '(the) mothers'

This suffix is not necessarily definite in all cases;
it can be used to refer to a group of people generally:
> ছাত্ররা পড়াশোনা করে। <br>
> *Chatrora pôṛashona kôre.* <br>
> 'Students study.'

## Cases

Bengali nouns have four cases: direct, objective, genitive, and locative.
Case indicates the function of a noun in a sentence.
The case of a noun is indicated using a suffix
which can also be preceded by a definite suffix.

### Direct Case

The direct case is the form of the noun without any extra suffixes
It is used for the subject of a verb,
like the nominative case in many European languages.
