---


This cheat sheet covers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_phonology" target="_blank">**Bangla phonology**</a>,
or the sounds used when speaking Bangla.
This page focuses mainly on the pronunciation of Bangla as spoken in Dhaka and other urban areas in Bangladesh.
The pronunciation in Kolkata and other parts of West Bengal differs slightly.
The pronunciation of each sound is given using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Bengali" target="_blank">International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>
An IPA chart with audio is available at
<a href="https://www.ipachart.com" target="_blank">ipachart.com</a>.
A rough English pronunciation is also given for each sound.

## Vowels

[<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Bengali/C7vz0ABJnJsC?hl=en&gbpv=0" target="_blank">Thompson</a> pp. 12--16]

Bangla has seven distinct vowel sounds, much like Italian.
You can click on the IPA for each sound to hear it pronounced.

| Letter | <a href="https://www.ipachart.com" target="_blank">IPA</a> | Pronunciation | Example |
| :---: | :-: | :------------ | :------ |
| **a** | <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Open_central_unrounded_vowel.ogg" target="_blank">/a/</a> | **a** in f**a**ther | আম ***a**m* 'mango' |
| **i** | <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Close_front_unrounded_vowel.ogg" target="_blank">/i/</a> | **ee** in s**ee**n | চিঠি *c**i**ṭh**i*** 'letter' |
| **u** | <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Close_back_rounded_vowel.ogg" target="_blank">/u/</a> | **oo** in f**oo**d | কুকুর *k**u**k**u**r* 'dog' |
| **e** | <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_front_unrounded_vowel" target="_blank">/e/</a> | **e** in Spanish m**e**sa | এইটা **e***iṭa* 'this one' |
| **ê** | <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Open-mid_front_unrounded_vowel.ogg" target="_blank">/ɛ/</a> | **e** in m**e**t | এক ***ê**k* 'one' |
| **o** | <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Close-mid_back_rounded_vowel.ogg" target="_blank">/o/</a> | **o** in Spanish n**o** | ওজন ***o**j**o**n* 'weight' |
| **ô** | <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/PR-open-mid_back_rounded_vowel.ogg" target="_blank">/ɔ/</a> | **aw** in l**aw** | অনেক ***ô**nek* 'a lot' |

### Nasalized Vowels

Bangla vowels can also be nasalized, which means that the sound goes through the nose
like in English 'huh?' and 'uh-huh'.
Nasalization is indicated with a tilde (~) above the vowel.
In Bangladeshi dialects, nasalized vowels are often either left out or pronounced as *n*.
Below is a comparison of how words with nasalized vowels are pronounced in
Standard Bengali and in Bangladeshi Bengali.

| Word | Standard | Bangladeshi |
| :--- | :------- | :---------- |
| কাঁদা 'to cry' | kãda | kanda, kada |
| ইঁদুর 'mouse' | ĩdur | indur, idur |
| ঝুঁকি 'risk' | jhũki | jhuki |
| পেঁয়াজ 'onion' | pẽaj | peaj |
| হ্যাঁ 'yes' | hễ | hễ |
| ধোঁয়া 'smoke' | dhõa | dhoa |
| পঁচাশি 'eighty-five' | pỗcashi | pôcashi |

Note that হ্যাঁ *hễ* 'yes' is always pronounced with a nasalized vowel,
even in dialects that don't use nasalized vowels in other words.

### The semivowels *y* and *w*

The semivowel *y* occurs between vowels and is pronounced more like *e*,
kind of like the **y** in la**y**er: *chaya, bayu, nôyon, mayer, diye, meye*.

Before a consonant, *y* sounds like *e*: *khay = khae, dêy = dêe, hôy = hôe*.

The semivowel *w* occurs between vowels and is pronounced more like *o*,
kind of like the **w** in lo**w**er: *gawa, hôwa, dêwa*.

## Consonants

[<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Bengali/C7vz0ABJnJsC?hl=en&gbpv=0" target="_blank">Thompson</a> pp. 16--18]

An important feature of Bangla consonants is called aspiration,
which is when a consonant is pronounced with a puff of air.
In English, for example, the **k** in **k**ite is aspirated,
while the **k** in s**k**y is not.
You can test this by holding a tissue in front of your mouth:
when pronouncing an aspirated consonant, the tissue will move,
while unaspirated consonants will not move the tissue.

### Velar stops (*k, kh, g, gh*)

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velar_consonant" target="_blank">velar</a>
stops are pronounced with the tongue against the soft palate, the back part of the roof of the mouth.
In English, the velar stops are **k** and **g**;
the Bangla velars are quite similar.

| Letter | <a href="https://www.ipachart.com" target="_blank">IPA</a> | Pronunciation | Example |
| :---: | :-: | :------------ | :------ |
| **k** | <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Voiceless_velar_plosive.ogg" target="_blank">/k/</a> | unaspirated **k** as in s**k**y | কি ***k**i* 'what?' |
| **kh** | /kʰ/ | aspirated **k** as in **k**ite | খাওয়া ***kh**aoa* 'to eat' |
| **g** | <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Voiced_velar_plosive_02.ogg" target="_blank">/g/</a> | **g** as in **g**o | গা ***g**a* 'body' |
| **gh** | /gʱ/ | aspirated *g*; like the **gh** in do**gh**ouse | ঘোড়া ***gh**oṛa* 'horse' |

### Palatal stops (*c, ch, j ,jh*)

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_consonant" target="_blank">palatal</a>
stops are really palatal affricates,
much like English **ch** as in **ch**in or **j** as in **j**uice.

| Letter | <a href="https://www.ipachart.com" target="_blank">IPA</a> | Pronunciation | Example |
| :---: | :-: | :------------ | :------ |
| **c** | <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Voiceless_alveolo-palatal_affricate.ogg" target="_blank">/t͡ɕ/</a> | **ch** as in **ch**in, but with no aspiration | চা ***c**a* 'tea' |
| **ch** | /t͡ɕʰ/ | aspirated **ch** as in **ch**in | গাছ *ga**ch*** 'tree, plant' |
| **j** | <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Voiced_alveolo-palatal_affricate.ogg" target="_blank">/d͡ʑ/</a> | **j** as in **j**uice | জানা ***j**ana* 'to know' |
| **jh** | /d͡ʑʱ/ | aspirated *j*; like the **dgeh** in he**dgeh**og | ঝাল ***jh**al* 'spicy' |

Note that *c* is pronounced like the **ch** in **ch**in,
not like the **c** in **c**ar.
You'll sometimes see Bengali people write *c* and *ch* as *ch* and *chh*
when writing Bangla informally using the Latin alphabet.
For example, চা *ca* 'tea' would be written *cha*.

In some dialects in Bangladesh, *c* and *ch* are pronounced like **s** in **s**un,
and *j* and *jh* are pronounced like *z* in *z*one.
In these dialects, *a**ch**e* 'there is/are' is pronounced as *a**s**e*.

### Retroflex stops (*ṭ, ṭh, ḍ, ḍh*)

This group of consonants is traditionally classified as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroflex_consonant" target="_blank">retroflex</a>,
but Bengalis generally pronounce these as closer to English
**t** as in **t**ime or **d** as in **d**ay.

| Letter | <a href="https://www.ipachart.com" target="_blank">IPA</a> | Pronunciation | Example |
| :---: | :-: | :------------ | :------ |
| **ṭ** | /t/ | unaspirated **t** as in s**t**ing | টানা ***ṭ**ana* 'to pull' |
| **ṭh** | /tʰ/ | aspirated **t** as in **t**in | ঠাণ্ডা ***ṭh**anḍa* 'cold' |
| **ḍ** | /d/ | **d** as in **d**ay | ডাকা ***ḍ**aka* 'to call' |
| **ḍh** | /dʱ/ | aspirated *ḍ*; like the **dh** in ma**dh**ouse | ঢেউ ***ḍh**eu* 'wave' |

### Dental stops (*t, th, d, dh*)

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_consonant" target="_blank">dental</a>
consonants are pronounced with the tongue right up against the teeth.
This is kind of like the **th** in English **th**in or **th**en,
but with your tongue directly touching your teeth instead of leaving any space.

| Letter | <a href="https://www.ipachart.com" target="_blank">IPA</a> | Pronunciation | Example |
| :---: | :-: | :------------ | :------ |
| **t** | <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Voiceless_dental_stop.ogg" target="_blank">/t̪/</a> | **th** in **th**in, but with the tongue touching the teeth | তুমি ***t**umi* 'you (informal)' |
| **th** | /t̪ʰ/ | aspirated t, like the **thh** in ba**thh**ouse | মাথা *ma**th**a* 'head' |
| **d** | <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Voiced_dental_stop.ogg" target="_blank">/d̪/</a> | **th** in **th**en, but with the tongue touching the teeth | দাম ***d**am* 'price' |
| **dh** | /d̪ʱ/ | aspirated *d* | ধান ***dh**an* 'rice plant' |

It's important to distinguish the dental consonants from the retroflex consonants,
as it can change the meaning of a word.
For example, তাক *tak* means 'shelf', while টাক *ṭak* means 'bald patch'.

### Labial stops (*p, ph, b, bh*)

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labial_consonant" target="_blank">labial</a>
stops are pronounced with the lips touching,
like English **p** and **b**.

| Letter | <a href="https://www.ipachart.com" target="_blank">IPA</a> | Pronunciation | Example |
| :---: | :-: | :------------ | :------ |
| **p** | <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Voiceless_bilabial_plosive.ogg" target="_blank">/p/</a> | unaspirated **p** in s**p**in | পানি ***p**ani* 'water' |
| **ph** | /pʰ/ <br> <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Voiceless_labiodental_fricative.ogg" target="_blank">/f/</a>| aspirated **p** in **p**in (West Bengal) <br> **f** in **f**an (Bangladesh) | ফুল ***ph**ul* 'head' |
| **b** | <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Voiced_bilabial_plosive.ogg" target="_blank">/b/</a> | **b** in **b**oy | বাবা ***b**a**b**a* 'father' |
| **bh** | /bʱ/ | aspirated *b*, like **b** in a**bh**or | ভালো ***bh**alo* 'good' |

The sound *ph* is pronounced like the **p** in **p**in in most West Bengali dialects
and like the **f** in **f**an in most Bangladeshi dialects.
For example, ফুল 'flower' is generally  pronounced *phul* in West Bengal and *ful* in Bangladesh.
On this website, w use *ph* to represent this sound to be inclusive of both pronunciations,
but sometimes we'll use *f* to emphasize that pronunciation if necessary.

### Nasals (*m, n, ng*)

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_consonant" target="_blank">nasal</a>
consonants are very similar to English.

| Letter | <a href="https://www.ipachart.com" target="_blank">IPA</a> | Pronunciation | Example |
| :---: | :-: | :------------ | :------ |
| **m** | /m/ | **m** in **m**o**m** | মা ***m**a* 'mother' |
| **n** | /n/ | **n** in **n**o | না ***n**a* 'no' |
| **ng** | /ŋ/ | **ng** in si**ng**er | বাঙালি 'ba**ng**ali' 'Bengali person' |

The sound **ng** cannot occur at the beginning of a word.

### Fricatives (*sh, s, h*)

The Bangla <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fricative" target="_blank">fricatives</a>
are pronounced exactly the way they are in English!

| Letter | <a href="https://www.ipachart.com" target="_blank">IPA</a> | Pronunciation | Example |
| :---: | :-: | :------------ | :------ |
| **sh** | /ʃ/ | **sh** in **sh**oe | শোয়া ***sh**oa* 'to lie down' |
| **s** | /s/ | **s** in **s**un | আস্তে *a**s**te* 'slowly' |
| **h** | /ɦ/ | **h** in **h**ot | হাত ***h**at* 'hand' |

The sound *s* usually doesn't occur on its own.
It's usually found before another consonant:
*আস্তে aste, বিশ্লেষণ bisleshon, বিস্ফোরণ bisphoron, শ্রেষ্ঠ sreshṭho*.
It's also used in loanwords from other languages:
*স্টেশন sṭeshon* 'station', *সাইক্লোন saiklon* 'cyclone'.

### Liquids (*r, ṛ, ṛh, l*)

There are three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_consonant" target="_blank">rhotics</a>,
or R-like sounds, in Bengali: *r*, *ṛ*, and *ṛh*.
The pronunciation of these sounds varies a lot from dialect to dialect.

In most Bangladeshi dialects,
*r*, *ṛ*, and *ṛh* are all pronounced as
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Alveolar_approximant.ogg" target="_blank">/ɹ/</a>,
or like the **r** in **r**ed.

In most West Bengali dialects,
*r*, *ṛ*, and *ṛh* are pronounced differently.

- *r* can be pronounced anywhere from the **r** in **r**ed to the
  tapped **r** in Spanish ca**r**o.
- *ṛ* is pronounced with as a tap with your tongue curled back,
  like a cross between English **r** and **d**.
  It's kind of like the **rd** in ga**rd**en in the General American accent.
  In IPA, this sound is written
  <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Retroflex_flap.ogg" target="_blank">/ɽ/</a>.
- *ṛh* is like *ṛ* but with aspiration,
  kind of like the **rdh** in gua**rdh**ouse in the General American accent.
  In IPA, this sound is written /ɽʱ/.

The sounds *ṛ* and *ṛh* cannot occur at the beginning of a word.

The sound *l* is pronounced
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Alveolar_lateral_approximant.ogg" target="_blank">/l/</a>,
like the **l** in **l**eave.
Keep in mind that this sound is quite light in Bangla,
not like the dark **l** in bott**l**e.

### Other consonants (*z*)

The sound *z* /z/ is pronounced just like English **z**, as in **z**ipper.
This sound is only used in loanwords from other languages,
such as জাকাত *zakat* 'charity', which comes from Arabic.
Many speakers will replace *z* with *j*,
pronouncing জাকাত as *jakat* instead.
