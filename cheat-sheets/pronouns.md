Like nouns, pronouns in Bangla have different forms
based on the case, or the function of the pronoun
in a sentence.
For more information on how each of the cases is used,
see our section on
[**noun cases**](/cheat-sheets/nouns#cases).

All pronouns in Bangla roughly use the same basic suffixes.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | -Ø | -রা *-ra* |
| **objective**  | -কে *ke* | -দের(কে) *-der(ke)* |
| **genitive**   | -র *-r* | -দের *-der* |

As discussed on our page about nouns,
the objective plural suffix is -দের *-der* in standard Bangla
and many West Bengali dialects.
In Bangladesh, the suffix -দেরকে *-derke* is more commonly used.
Throughout this page, this suffix is listed as -দের(কে) *-der(ke)*
to account for both forms.

## First-Person Pronouns

The first-person pronouns correspond to the forms of English
'I' and 'we'.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | আমি *ami* <br> 'I' | আমরা *amra* <br> 'we' |
| **objective**  | আমাকে *ami* <br> '(to) me' | আমাদের(কে) *amader(ke)* <br> '(to) us' |
| **genitive**   | আমার *amar* <br> 'my' | আমাদের *amader* <br> 'our' |

## Second-Person Pronouns

The second-person pronouns correspond to the forms of English 'you'.
In many dialects of English,
'you' is used in both the singular and plural, while
Bangla differentiates the singular and plural usages.
To keep things simple, we'll use 'y'all' when referring to the plural 'you'.

In Bangla, the pronoun used for 'you' depends on the level of politeness.
The three levels of politeness are polite, familiar, and intimate.
The basic forms of these pronouns are summarized in the table below.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **intimate** | তুই *tui*  | তোরা *tora* |
| **familiar** | তুমি *tumi* | তোমরা *tomra* |
| **polite**   | আপনি *apni* | আপনারা *apnara* |

The full forms and usage of each of these pronouns are
detailed in the next few sections.

### Intimate second-person pronouns (তুই *tui*, তোরা *tora*)

The intimate second-person pronouns তুই *tui* and তোরা *tora*
are used between siblings and close friends of the same age.
Adults can also use তুই *tui* when talking to children.
Using তুই *tui* outside of close relationships
comes across as rude or insulting and should be avoided.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | তুই *tui* <br> 'you' | তোরা *tora* <br> 'y'all' |
| **objective**  | তোকে *toke* <br> '(to) you' | তোদের(কে) *toder(ke)* <br> '(to) y'all' |
| **genitive**   | তোর *tor* <br> 'your' | তোদের *toder* <br> 'y'all's' |

### Familiar second-person pronouns (তুমি *tumi*, তোমরা *tomra*)

The familiar second-person pronouns তুমি *tumi* and তোমরা *tomra*
are typically used between relatives, friends, and romantic partners.
Most people use তুমি *tumi* when talking to someone
younger than them.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | তুমি *tumi* <br> 'you' | তোমরা *tomra* <br> 'y'all' |
| **objective**  | তোমাকে *tomake* <br> '(to) you' | তোমাদের(কে) *tomader(ke)* <br> '(to) y'all' |
| **genitive**   | তোমার *tomar* <br> 'your' | তোমাদের *tomader* <br> 'y'all's' |

### Polite second-person pronouns (আপনি *apni*, আপনারা *apnara*)

The polite second-person pronouns আপনি *apni* and আপনারা *apnara*
are used to address strangers, acquaintances,
superiors and elders, and other respected individuals.
Some people refer to their parents and parents-in-law
using আপনি *apni*, but this is become less common over time.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | আপনি *apni* <br> 'you' | আপনারা *apnara* <br> 'y'all' |
| **objective**  | আপনাকে *apnake* <br> '(to) you' | আপনাদের(কে) *apnader(ke)* <br> '(to) y'all' |
| **genitive**   | আপনার *apnar* <br> 'your' | আপনাদের *apnader* <br> 'y'all's' |

## Third-Person Pronouns

In English, we distinguish gender in third-person pronouns:
'he', 'she', and 'it'.
Bangla does not have this gender distinction.
Rather, the third-person pronouns in Bangla
are distinguished based on status (ordinary and honorific),
and proximity to the speaker (proximal, medial, and distal).
The singular form of each of the combinations
of status and proximity are listed in the table below.
| | ordinary | honorific |
| :- | :- | :- |
| **proximal** | এ *e* | ইনি *ini* |
| **medial** | ও *o* | উনি *uni* |
| **distal** | সে *she* | তিনি *tini* |

The forms and usage of each of these pronouns is given in the following sections.

### Proximal third-person pronouns (এ *e*, ইনি *ini*)

The proximal third-person pronoun এ *e* is used to
refer to someone physically near you.
It is most often used when introducing someone to
someone else.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | এ *e* <br> 'he, she' | এরা *era* <br> 'they' |
| **objective**  | একে *eke* <br> '(to) him, her' | এদের(কে) *eder(ke)* <br> '(to) them' |
| **genitive**   | এর *er* <br> 'his, her' | এদের *eder* <br> 'their' |

The honorific form ইনি *ini* is used instead of এ *e*
to refer to someone with respect.
The forms of ইনি *ini* in standard Bangla are given below.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | ইনি *ini* <br> 'he, she' | এঁরা *ẽra* <br> 'they' |
| **objective**  | এঁকে *ẽke* <br> '(to) him, her' | এঁদের *ẽder* <br> '(to) them' |
| **genitive**   | এঁর *ẽr* <br> 'his, her' | এঁদের *ẽder* <br> 'their' |

In many dialects of Bangla, especially in Bangladesh,
the forms of উনি *uni* differ from the standard forms.
These are the forms that most speakers will use
in daily conversation.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | ইনি *ini* <br> 'he, she' | এনারা *enara* <br> 'they' |
| **objective**  | এনাকে *enake* <br> '(to) him, her' | এনাদের(কে) *enader(ke)* <br> '(to) them' |
| **genitive**   | এনার *enar* <br> 'his, her' | এনাদের *enader* <br> 'their' |

### Medial third-person pronouns (ও *o*, উনি *uni*)

In most contexts, ও *o* is the default third-person pronoun,
used much like how we would normally use
'he', 'she', or singular 'they' in English.
The forms of ও *o* are given below.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | ও *o* <br> 'he, she' | ওরা *ora* <br> 'they' |
| **objective**  | ওকে *oke* <br> '(to) him, her' | ওদের(কে) *oder(ke)* <br> '(to) them' |
| **genitive**   | ওর *or* <br> 'his, her' | ওদের *oder* <br> 'their' |

Likewise, the honorific form উনি *uni* is the most common
way to refer to someone with respect.
The forms of উনি *uni* in standard Bangla are given below.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | উনি *uni* <br> 'he, she' | ওঁরা *õra* <br> 'they' |
| **objective**  | ওঁকে *õke* <br> '(to) him, her' | ওঁদের *õder* <br> '(to) them' |
| **genitive**   | ওঁর *õr* <br> 'his, her' | ওঁদের *õder* <br> 'their' |

In many dialects of Bangla, especially in Bangladesh,
the forms of উনি *uni* differ from the standard forms.
These are the forms that most speakers will use
in daily conversation.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | উনি *uni* <br> 'he, she' | ওনারা *onara* / <br> উনারা *unara* <br> 'they' |
| **objective**  | ওনাকে *onake* / <br> উনাকে *unake* <br> '(to) him, her' | ওনাদের(কে) *onader(ke)* / <br> উনাদেরকে *unaderke* <br> '(to) them' |
| **genitive**   | ওনার *onar* / <br> উনার *unar* <br> 'his, her' | ওনাদের *onader* / <br> উনাদের *unader* <br> 'their' |

### Distal third-person pronouns (সে *she*, তিনি *tini*)

The distal third-person pronoun সে *she* is used to
refer to someone physically far from you.
It is often interchangeable with ও *o*,
but it sounds slightly more formal to many speakers.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | সে *she* <br> 'he, she' | তারা *tara* <br> 'they' |
| **objective**  | তাকে *take* <br> '(to) him, her' | তাদের(কে) *tader(ke)* <br> '(to) them' |
| **genitive**   | তার *tar* <br> 'his, her' | তাদের *tader* <br> 'their' |

The honorific form তিনি *tini* is used instead of সে *she*
to refer to someone with respect.
For many speakers, তিনি *tini* is thus the most formal and respectful pronoun.
Unlike ইনি *ini* and উনি *uni*,
the forms of তিনি *tini* are the same in the standard
and in many dialects.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | তিনি *tini* <br> 'he, she' | তাঁরা *tãra* <br> 'they' |
| **objective**  | তাঁকে *tãke* <br> '(to) him, her' | তাঁদের(কে) *tãder(ke)* <br> '(to) them' |
| **genitive**   | তাঁর *tãr* <br> 'his, her' | তাঁদের *tãder* <br> 'their' |
