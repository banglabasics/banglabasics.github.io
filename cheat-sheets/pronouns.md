Like nouns, pronouns in Bangla have different forms
based on the case, or the function of the pronoun
in a sentence.
For more information on how each of the cases is used,
see our section on
[**noun cases**](/cheat-sheets/nouns#cases).

## First-Person Pronouns

The first-person pronouns correspond to the forms of English
'I' and 'we'.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | আমি *ami* <br> 'I' | আমরা *amra* <br> 'we' |
| **objective**  | আমাকে *ami* <br> '(to) me' | আমাদের(কে) *amader(ke)* <br> '(to) us' |
| **genitive**   | আমার *amar* <br> 'my' | আমাদের *amader* <br> 'our' |

## Second-Person Pronouns

The second-person pronouns correspond to the forms of English 'you'.
In many dialects of English,
'you' is used in both the singular and plural, while
Bangla differentiates the singular and plural usages.
To keep things simple, we'll use 'y'all' when referring to the plural 'you'.

In Bangla, the pronoun used for 'you' depends on the level of politeness.
The three levels of politeness are polite, familiar, and intimate.

### Polite second-person pronouns (আপনি *apni*, আপনারা *apnara*)

The polite second-person pronouns আপনি *apni* and আপনারা *apnara*
are used to address strangers, acquaintances,
superiors and elders, and other respected individuals.
Some people refer to their parents and parents-in-law
using আপনি *apni*, but this is become less common over time.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | আপনি *apni* <br> 'you' | আপনারা *apnara* <br> 'y'all' |
| **objective**  | আপনাকে *apnake* <br> '(to) you' | আপনাদের(কে) *apnader(ke)* <br> '(to) y'all' |
| **genitive**   | আপনার *apnar* <br> 'your' | আপনাদের *apnader* <br> 'y'all's' |

### Familiar second-person pronouns (তুমি *tumi*, তোমরা *tomra*)

The familiar second-person pronouns তুমি *tumi* and তোমরা *tomra*
are typically used between relatives, friends, and romantic partners.
Most people use তুমি *tumi* when talking to someone
younger than them.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | তুমি *tumi* <br> 'you' | তোমরা *tomra* <br> 'y'all' |
| **objective**  | তোমাকে *tomake* <br> '(to) you' | তোমাদের(কে) *tomader(ke)* <br> '(to) y'all' |
| **genitive**   | তোমার *tomar* <br> 'your' | তোমাদের *tomader* <br> 'y'all's' |

### Intimate second-person pronouns (তুই *tui*, তোরা *tora*)

The intimate second-person pronouns তুই *tui* and তোরা *tora*
are used between siblings and close friends of the same age.
Adults can also use তুই *tui* when talking to children.
Using তুই *tui* outside of close relationships
comes across as rude or insulting and should be avoided.

|    | singular | plural |
| :- | :------- | :----- |
| **nominative** | তুই *tui* <br> 'you' | তোরা *tora* <br> 'y'all' |
| **objective**  | তোকে *toke* <br> '(to) you' | তোদের(কে) *toder(ke)* <br> '(to) y'all' |
| **genitive**   | তোর *tor* <br> 'your' | তোদের *toder* <br> 'y'all's' |
