Bangla Basics is run by [Shaandro Sarkar](https://shaandro.github.io).
I'm native speaker of Bangla with an interest in sharing my language with people from all over the world!
Everything on this site is provided to you completely free of charge.
If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, feel free to contact me via

Most of the information on this website comes from my own knowledge as a native speaker of Bangla.
I've also referenced Hanne-Ruth Thompson's *Bengali* (2012),
which is an excellent resource for those seeking information outside of the scope of this website.
