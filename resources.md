## Bangla-specific resources
There's all sorts of great resources for learning Bangla on the Internet and elsewhere!
Here are some of the ones I've found useful.

- [**Bangla-Tangla**](https://www.banglatangla.com) is a phenomenal resource.
  You can search Bangla-Tangla's own Bangla-English Dictionary in addition to the two dictionaries linked below.
  Bangla-Tangla also features a verb conjugator, Chrome extension, and a bunch of other useful tools!
- [**Samsad Bengali-English Dictionary**](https://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/biswas-bengali/)
  is a searchable dictionary that gives definitions of Bangla words in English.
  This dictionary is also available on [Bangla-Tangla](https://www.banglatangla.com).
- [**Samsad Bangla Dictionary**](https://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/biswas-bangala/)
  (সংসদ বাংলা উচ্চারণ অভিধান *Šôṅšod Baṅla Obhidhan*)
  is a searchable Bangla dictionary with definitions solely in Bangla.
  It has uncommon vocabulary you may not find elsewhere,
  making it helpful for intermediate to advanced learners.
  This dictionary is also searchable on [Bangla-Tangla](https://www.banglatangla.com).
- [**Samsad Bangla Pronunciation Dictionary**](https://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/bhattacharya/)
  (সংসদ বাংলা উচ্চারণ অভিধান *Šôṅšod Baṅla Uccaron Obhidhan*)
  gives the pronunciation of Bangla words, which is super helpful when you can't figure out how a word is pronounced.
  Pronunciations are given using the [International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Bengali).
- [**Hanne-Ruth Thompson's *Bengali* (2012)**](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Bengali/C7vz0ABJnJsC?hl=en&gbpv=0) is a comprehensive Bangla grammar.
  I've referenced it a lot while creating the lessons on this website,
  and it's perfect for intermediate and advanced learners who want a deeper understanding of Bangla.

## General language-learning resources
Besides the Bangla-specific resources listed above, there are numerous language-learning websites and apps available!
- **Language exchange services** are websites and apps that connect you with speakers of the languages you're learning
  who want to learn your language, allowing you to exchange your knowledge with each other.
  Some options are [**Speaky**](https://www.speaky.com/), [**HelloTalk**](https://www.hellotalk.com/),
  [**Tandem**](https://www.tandem.net/), and [**italki**](https://www.italki.com/).
- [**Anki**](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) is a flashcard application that is great for learning vocabulary.
  Instead of reviewing all of your flashcards every day,
  Anki schedules which cards you should review for you.
